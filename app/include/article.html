                           <p>Intelligent Car Leasing has enjoyed a great relationship with Celtic and have been major supporters of Celtic FC Foundation, with £10 from every vehicle leased through their website being donated to the Club’s charitable arm.    This will continue under new deal.</p>
                           <p>ICL have been club partners since 2014 and since then they also provide Celtic’s Club cars.</p>
